---Nodejs

*Javascript was once only a front-end language
*It was basically a designed to run on browser engine only 
(like v8 engine in chrome browser for running javascript)
*Nodejs comes in market after 2009

*Nodejs is runtime envirnment that enable to run javascript without need of browser 
*nodejs is asyncronous and does not wait for things to be done
(like fetching data from api) , it can run other code while some other
task is being done backwards and does not wait at all for completion of one task

*Nodejs is "single threaded" 

*request of data or any task recieved by thread and another request
of some other task will not be entertain until first one completed and its
gets free
*this is single threading


---event loop

*whenever there is a task that is require to be done/execute ,a 
que(line) is formed in callstack which is  execution stack containing
 tasks to be execute  in a que.
 
*normally whatever is enter in hte que execute first then its later ones

*but there is a prioritywise execution machanism

*there is  Taskque(also called callback que) and microtask que
*"microtask" que has more priority than a simple "Task" que

*if you run a promise and setTimeout for asyncronous tasks,then in this scenario
the promise has more priority than setTimeout even if then runs at same time
,even if you put setTimeOut before Promise still Promise runs and prints
first

--types of apps

*There are two types of apps:

1)IO-Intensive Apps
2)CPU Intensive Apps

*for IO intensive Apps Nodejs is used
*for CPU Intensive app java or backend technologies runs

*CPU Intensive apps are hardware intensive apps like photoshop
or afteraffect sofware which need gpus are CPU intensive apps

*IO intensive used for basic getting and displaying data, it also use
CPU but not extensively as other one


*Node also has pakage manager which a directory storing all Node 
related pakages needed to use in projects

*always install LTS version to install Nodejs as it is most stable version

---using node to runn javascript file

*with command "node index.js" you can run javascript inside terminal

*in the way above you only have run the javascript file not the actual backend app


---using node to run backend app


*you need to make server and allot it the space in your system through
assigning "port" to  run specific server.

*as each device has a seprate IP address so this address is assign 
to the port in heich the server will run

*but as we run multiple server/application in one device and IPaddress is same
*in this situation we assign portnumber after IP address to seprate the each application

for example "192.168.0.133:port"

*to run your server in port you need a pakage which is called "HTTP"

but there are some issues with HTTP pakage

--issues if http:

1)it uses pure node which means you need to write alot of code to use
2)to responsive a servrer request we also need to write alot of code again

---Expressjs

*here comes express.js framework which helps us to make server effiicemtly
*it is use to make servrs and also ca be use to other tasks usually which
is done my node which are quite lenghty

*you need pakage.json for details about project like names , 
dependencies for distinguishing project

*the command for creating pakage.json file is "npm init"

*after making pakage.json now add start command under script tags:
  "start": "node index.js"

*this will enable you to use "npm start" and using it will run your index.js file


now install express framework using command:

npm i express

*you can use modules like imort/export in node as well which is supported here

----initializing express


*the express function you import from "express" will return its features whch you save in 
*but need to mention 
"type":"modules"
in pakage.json


*app.listen lets you create port ,it takes IP address automatically but port name must be given like(3000,4000,8000)

*.listen also take a call back function as its parameters

*after starting your app you will see the console printing

"your server running on 3000"

*local host gets your iP address automatically thats why we use it 


---HTTP request

*it is when we request through an Ip is called HTTPS request

---HTTP methods

*this include:

get:to retrieve response data from this source(by default it in browser search bar)
post:to send data to server(submit data) usually in form of object
put:update the entire data object
delete:to delete the object data
patch:it also update it with partially (like changing phone number only)

---.get() request

*.get takes "end point" as its first parameter in our case we provide "/"

*.get takes a call back functiona as seconf argument

*callback function has 2 parameters (request,response)

*request has data when user hit the source like frontend data
*response include data to be drnd when there eis get request

*res.send() method we use to give dummy data to show in our app
